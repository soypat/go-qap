# go-qap
To solve the document naming convention problem.
---

Implementation of CERN's quality assurance plan (QAP) in pure Go.

_This is a WIP._


### Motivation
Startups in the business of mechanical engineering have limited choices
when it comes to choosing cost effective PLM software.

In particular there is a real and immediate need to document deliverables
and keep them organized in an electronic file repository.

This repository seeks to fully solve the problem regarding 
**document naming conventions**. This may seem like a trivial task but it is something
that has been given a great deal of thought, not least by [those in charge of
the LHC project at CERN](https://edms.cern.ch/ui/file/103547/1.1/QAp202rev1-2.pdf).
